In this project, I analyzed customer purchasing behavior to calculate:

Total orders and total revenue per customer

Time since last purchase

Key segmentation metrics to support targeted marketing

This hands-on experience helped me practice writing complex queries, JOINs, aggregations, and business logic using real-world retail data.
